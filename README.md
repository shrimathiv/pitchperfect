# App Description

PitchPerfect is an iOS application that I made while taking the course "Intro to iOS App Development with Swift" on Udacity.

This application records sound produced by the user and allows the user to apply sound effects to the recorded audio. Effects currently supported are: slow (speed), fast (speed), low (pitch), high (pitch), echo and reverb.
